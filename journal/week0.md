I learnt to explore and configure the AWS console, IAM, CLI, budget and billing services respectively.
I was able to create a conceptual and architecture diagram of the cruddr project in Lucid.
I was able to create accounts in github, gitpod, momento and Lucid chart respectively, although I didn't sign up for the payment version which had limitations on my architectural diagram.
I was able to input my task within the repo specified.
I have the AWS CLI installed on my PC prior to the bootcamp. 
I was able to use the lucid app to create the conceptual diagram.
